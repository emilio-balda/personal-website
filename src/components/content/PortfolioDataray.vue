    Together with a team of 3 developers, we built a data science SaaS product called Dataray. The backend is built in Python, using FastAPI and DJango. The frontend is built in TypeScript, using Vue 3 and Tailwindcss. It is hosted in Google Cloud using Kubernetes and Helm. Tests are written with pytest and integration tests are implemented with GitLab CI.
