    The goal was to publish a journal about new algorithms to generate "adversarial examples". I designed a mathematical framework that allowed me to derive new algorithms suited for different computer vision tasks. These algorithms outperformed their counterparts in the task of fooling neural networks. The paper was published in the renowned journal "IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing".
